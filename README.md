# pre-commit-hook-for-FE-devs
A php file acting as a pre-commit hook file for any git repository in order to preventing commits of debugging code remainders

The original file is not from me, but from someone else. In case you know the originator of this file, please inform me - I'd love to get in touch and also add credentials to this project.

This file should serve as a base for frontend developers working on PHP projects/websites who want to use a pre-commit hook that prevents them from committing unresolved merge conflicts, debugging output or enabled oder disabled conditions for debugging purposes that she/he has forgotten about.

Any suggestion/improvement/comment highly welcome!
