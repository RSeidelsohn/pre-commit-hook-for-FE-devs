# pre-commit-hook-for-FE-devs
A php file acting as a pre-commit hook file for any git repository in order to preventing commits of debugging code remainders

The original file comes from Phil Wright- Christie and you can find hie much more elaborate [project 'code quality' here](https://github.com/philwc/code-quality).He kindly gave me the permission to use that file in my project here.

This file should serve as a base for frontend developers working on PHP projects/websites who want to use a pre-commit hook that prevents them from committing unresolved merge conflicts, debugging output or enabled oder disabled conditions for debugging purposes that she/he has forgotten about.

Any suggestion/improvement/comment highly welcome!
